# Fetch-Rewards


### Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst


Hello, This is Tharun, and this assesment consits of all the answers needed.

Requirements for completing this assesment are:

MySQL WorkBench
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Jupyter Notebook
Installation with mamba or conda
JupyterLab can be installed with mamba and conda:

> mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

or

> conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

Note: If you have not installed mamba or conda yet, you can get started with the miniforge distribution.

Installation with pip
If you use pip, you can install it with:

> pip install jupyterlab

If installing using pip install --user, you must add the user-level bin directory to your PATH environment variable in order to launch jupyter lab. If you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" command.

I did the ER Diagram using MYSQL Workbench, which I felt is the Best way doing it.





The datasets were downloaded from the link provided in https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/analytics-engineer/ineeddata-data-modeling/data-modeling.html.

The JSON files, are then extracted, and loaded using Jupyter Notebook converted to CSV. The code for converting from JSON to CSV is included in the ipynb file.
